## 💡 **My Recommendation: Start with Stripe**

**Why Stripe First?**
1. You have credentials ready
2. Fundamental feature (monetization)
3. Other features depend on user tier
4. Good learning experience
5. Can test in development first

**Alternative: Start with Google APIs**
1. Faster (1-2 weeks vs 2-3 weeks)
2. Builds credibility first
3. Free forever
4. Then add Stripe
